Annoying Game
This program is a game made for playing. You can play it by running the program. The goal is to get to the end. 
I tested the program by running it, and going through the whole thing, multiple times. I did this at various points while making the code, to make sure it was working correctly for me to continue working on it.
This method proved to be quite inefficent, so I added a secret at the first input. If you input "skip" you'll be taken to the Skipping Terminal, where you'll be able to skip certain areas of the code.
I learned how to use Try and Except, and understood things better, like While Loops and Functions.
I was challenged by something in my code. It was a section which used mathematics. I read in the rubric, that I'd need to use mathematics, so I added a section of that in my code.
